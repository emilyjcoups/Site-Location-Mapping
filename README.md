# Site Location Mapping 
> Jupyter notebook which reads in and combines three raster files and plots a final map of the UK based on user priorities. 

### Summary 
__Reads in raster files corresponding to three site traits: geology, transport (proximity of motorway), and working population.__

__User sets the weighting for each attribute via GUI sliders.__

__Final map incorporating each weighted attribute plotted using matplotlib.pyplot__

__The user can toggle between viewing the top ten percent of sites or all sites in the final display.__

__Once the user is happy with the weighting, they can save the final map data to a text file.__

### Installation
